## üöÄ How to Run This Project

To reproduce the analysis and results, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git)
cd Your-Repo-Name
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'myenv'
python3 -m venv myenv
```
```bash
# Activate the environment
source myenv/bin/activate
```
(Your terminal prompt should now show (myenv))

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Install all the necessary packages using the requirements.txt file.

```Bash
# Install all libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4.Run the Jupyter Notebooks

You can now run the notebooks. The easiest way is to open the project in VS Code.
You can now explore and all the models and notebooks.
When prompted, select the kernel from your virtual environment (e.g., Python 3.x.x ('myenv')).
